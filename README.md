# Cellular-Automata-Maze-Solver

This code is based on this [Programming Challenge](https://sigmageek.com/challenge/stone-automata-maze-challenge) hosted by Sigmageek. The problem description should provide all description necessary, but if it still not clear, the problem could be resumed by being able to solve a maze ruled by [Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), like if we took [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and made a maze game out of it.

The code is still in beta and can be improved way further, since the current solution basically brute forces through the maze states and do not scale well in larger mazes.
